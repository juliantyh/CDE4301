        <p>
          This project is done in collaboration with Duke-NUS and SGH to increase the adoption of endoscopic resection
          by Gastroenterologists for pre-cancerous gastric subepithelial/submucosal lesions (Gastrointestinal Stromal
          Tumors and Neuroendocrine Neoplasms) and early gastric cancer less than 3 cm, from 2% to 40% within 5 years,
          by achieving efficacy (R0 resection) and safety (complication rates) comparable to the gold standard of
          surgical resection and making the procedure easier, safer and faster.

          <div id="sub-section-4-header-1"></div>
          <h3>2.1. Subepithelial lesions</h3>
          <p>
            Subepithelial lesions (SELs) in the digestive tract refer to abnormal lesions originating from the various
            layers under the mucosa, and upper gastrointestinal SELs are the most common (Su et al., 2021).
          </p>
          <p>
            They are commonly identified during routine endoscopic procedures. Gastric Subepithelial lesions are a
            rather
            frequent finding, occurring in about 0.36% (or around 1 in 300) of routine upper GI-endoscopies
            (Papanikolaou
            et al., 2011).
          </p>

            style="max-width: 50%; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></image-component>
          <p>
            Subepithelial lesions are often incidentally discovered and often go unnoticed by patients until they are
            discovered during screening for unrelated conditions. If symptoms do exist, chronic anaemia from
            intermittent
            GI bleeding is most common (Humphris & Jones, 2008). Other symptoms include abdominal pain and luminal
            obstruction, depending on the site and size of the lesion. Subepithelial lesions have a 15% risk of
            malignant
            potential (Polkowski, 2005). Men and women are equally affected, and most patients are more than 50 years
            old
            at the time of diagnosis. (Menon & Buscaglia, 2013)

          <h3>2.2. Current Standard of Care</h3>
          <p>
            Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) and Endoscopic Full Thickness Resection (EFTR) are the current
            standard
            of care for the resection of subepithelial lesions. They are minimally invasive procedures to remove lesions
            located beneath the mucosal layer of the digestive tract. They are types of therapeutic endoscopy used to
            remove large polyps or early cancers without the need for open surgery. The procedures use an endoscope to
            accurately remove growth without removing large portions of the organ involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            1) ESD is the current standard-of-care. It is a resection technique where the endoscopist cuts through the
            mucosa using an electrosurgical knife, locates the lesion and removes it and closes the mucosal defect.
          </p>
          <!-- image component -->

            subtitle="Figure 2: Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) Procedure (Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD): Gleneagles Hospital 2024)"></image-component>
          <p>
            2) EFTR, is a full-thickness or deep wall resection of a small piece of the complete GI wall. It is mainly
            done using the OVESCO FTRDÂ® System, which is an integrated closure and resection device for use in the lower
            intestinal tract (Aslanian et al., 2019). It is a resection technique where the endoscopist grabs hold of
            the
            lesion, pulls multiple layers of the stomach wall into the cap, clips below the tissue to trap the lesion,
            then slices through the stomach wall. (Cai et al., 2018)

        <div id="sub-section-5-header-1"></div>
        <h3>3.1 Benefits of Endoscopic Resection (ER)</h3>
        <p>
          We chose to focus on ER as it has a high efficacy for the resection of GISTs. In the past, patients with the
          diagnosis of GISTs were mainly treated by open surgery or laparoscopic wedge resection (Madhavan et al., 2018;
          Ishikawa et al., 2006; Guo et al., 2019), Compared with open surgery, endoscopic therapy has great advantages
          in
          surgical time, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative recovery (Ishikawa et al., 2006; Joensuu et al.,
          2013; Guo et al., 2019)
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared to laparoscopic wedge resection, endoscopic treatment provides a clearer operative view to identify a
          precise resection area without needless extensive excision. Additionally, ER can preserve most structures of
          the
          stomach with normal digestive physiology maintained, and patients can get a better quality of life (Meng et
          al.,
          2015; Yu et al., 2017; Guo et al., 2019)
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="sub-section-5-header-2">
        <h3>3.2 Increasing Demand for Endoscopic Resection (ER)</h3>
        <p>
          There is an increasing demand for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures due to:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            An aging population. In 2010, about 1 in 10 Singaporeans were aged 65 and above. A decade later, in 2020,
            it
            has risen to about 1 in 6. By 2030, another 10 years later, it would be almost 1 in 4 Singaporeans over 65
            (Lee,
            2023).
          </li>
          <li>
            There is also a rising prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders and other chronic conditions around the
            world. According to the World Health Organization, Stomach Cancer is the 3rd deadliest cancer in the world.
            In
            Singapore, it is the 4th most common cause of cancer death in men, and 5th most common in women, claiming
            300
            to
            500 lives every year. The main reason for this is late detection - 2/3 of Stomach Cancer patients are only
            diagnosed at an advanced stage (Cancer Information - Stomach Cancer (Gastric Cancer) 2022).
          </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          The global endoscopic device market size is projected to increase from USD 56.5 billion in 2024 to
          approximately
          USD 104.74 billion by 2033. The market is expected to grow at a solid Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of
          7.1%
          during the forecast period from 2024 to 2033.
        </p>

        <p>
          Therefore, improving the efficiency and safety of gastrointestinal lesion resection in the endoscopic device
          industry will save many lives as it is a growing market with a growing demographic that need these procedures.

          <h3>4.2 Limitations of EFTR</h3>
          <p>
            After our clinical immersion, we decided to focus on improving Endoscopic Full Thickness Resection (EFTR)
            due to the technical challenges faced by SGH Endoscopists that we interviewed when they use the FTRD to do
            this procedure. This includes problems with visibility, securing the lesion, insufficient wound closure,
            ease of use and team coordination (Details in Table 1).
          </p>
          <p>
            The key problems are:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              During EFTR, it is difficult to determine if the lesion has been completely removed. Two mistakes can
              occur. First, the device captures normal tissue instead of the lesion. Second, the lesion is only
              partially
              resected by the device.
            </li>
            <li>
              During EFTR, it is difficult to ensure that the endoscopic clips close mucosal defects sufficiently to
              prevent perforation of stomach wall and post-procedural bleeding.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Addressing these limitations enables more efficient resections, resulting in better patient outcomes.
            Due to these technical challenges, FTRD has a limited uptake, leaving ESD as the primary choice despite its
            longer procedure time and high difficulty. This was validated during our clinical immersion. From our
            interviews at the SGH Ambulatory Endoscopy Centre (AEC), within the department, only two endoscopists are
            confident to attempt the FTRD procedure with a high success rate. Additionally, from our interview with an
            endoscopist based in the USA, only 2% of Gastroenterologists in the USA perform endoscopic resection of
            subepithelial lesions using the Full Thickness Resection Device, or FTRDÂ®.

            To fill the identified gap in the market, we have developed the following value proposition:
          </p>
          <p>
            Our proposed solution makes the process of endoscopic resection of gastric subepithelial lesions and early
            gastric cancer just as safe and effective as surgical wedge resection, while being faster than the current
            standard-of-care endoscopic resection technique, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD). It also securely
            captures the subepithelial lesion and ensures complete resection while reducing the risk of perforation and
            retaining resection efficiency, which improves on challenges faced by endoscopists when using the FTRDÂ®
            System.

            <image-component tag="image" source="assets/concept2.png"
              subtitle="Table 13: Concept Details"></image-component>

            <p>
              <b>Concept 1A and 1B</b> both employ a biomaterial to detect the lesion's position, along with a metal
              mesh to
              constrict the lesion. However, Concept 1A incorporates an electrical pressure sensor for lesion detection,
              while Concept 1B utilizes microneedles and biochemical detection to visually indicate the lesionâs
              position on the mucosal surface. Both concepts then utilize an Endoloop with clips for wound closure, with
              the biomaterial also assisting in this process.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Concept 1C</b> streamlines the approaches of Concepts 1A and 1B by utilizing a miniaturized version of
              the
              existing Apollo Overstitch technology. This concept creates a purse-string stitch around the lesion,
              pulling the corners of any flat lesion into a pedunculated shape, facilitating easier cutting.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Concept 2</b> introduces a "Cookie Cutter" mechanism for full-thickness resection. It features a Micro
              Ultrasound Probe positioned adjacent to the lesion to monitor potential cuts into vital structures and to
              ensure complete capture of the lesion. This concept employs a tissue helix/forceps to grasp the lesion,
              with it acting as a guide to the lesion. The Cookie Cutter is positioned over the lesion and pushes down
              on the stomach wall for a vacuum seal to be created while suction is applied. These steps prevent the
              lesion from moving laterally. The Cookie Cutter slices downward around the lesion, resulting in a
              cylindrical slice of stomach wall. The endoscopist then checks the Ultrasound Probe to ensure that the
              lesion is completely captured. After confirming that the lesion is secure, the clip is then deployed to
              trap the lesion and pre-close the wound. Following this, a circular knifeâlike a camera shutterâor a
              snare, slices the base of the cylindrical section to complete the full-thickness resection.

            <h3>7.5 Concept Selection</h3>
            <p>
              We evaluated the 4 concepts based on the Must-Have and Nice-To-Have Criteria
            </p>
            <p>
              We used a Pugh Matrix where we listed our evaluation criteria to evaluate each solution and weighed them
              based on whether each concept satisfied each criterion.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Pugh matrix helped us to determine using an unbiased analysis that although Concept 1A and 1B gives
              the best outcome if successfully developed, Concept 1C and Concept 2 have less negatives with a similar
              effectiveness. After consulting our clinical mentor, Dr. Ravi and our industry mentor, Mr Peter Cheng, we
              decided that Concept 2 was the most feasible to design and test. Therefore, we chose to move forward with
              Concept 2.

              It can perform Dual-Plane Reconstruction (DPR) which makes it possible to display radial and linear
              ultrasound images simultaneously on a single monitor in real time. By generating two dimensions that
              correlate directly with one another, DPR allows the user to observe both the penetration and longitudinal
              border of a region of interest. This makes it possible to more accurately assess tissue invasion and more
              specifically whether the subepithelial lesion has been captured.

              This stage is where the endoscope approaches the subepithelial lesion, and the tissue helix descends to

            <p>
              This stage is where after obtaining confirmation that the lesion is completely captured, the endoscopic
              clip is deployed to trap the lesion. We will use the OVESCO over-the-scope clip (OTSC).

            <p>
              We selected OTSC because OTSC achieved the highest closure rate of 98.2% (Dohi et al., 2020). The
              advantages of OTSC over TTSC are: (1) larger lesions can be closed by one clip (limited by cap diameter
              and flexibility of the tissue being pulled into the cap); and (2) greater compression force. Also, the
              nitinol clip provides constant compression forces of 8 to 9 Newton, which is necessary for successful
              permanent closure of defects (Mennigen et al., 2014; Kirschniak et al., 2007).

              This stage is where the snare is heated and then pulled, slicing the base of cylindrical section. The
              subepithelial lesion is resected above the endoscopic clip. The mucosa and submucosal defects are closed
              by the previously applied endoscopic clip.

            <p>
              To fulfill our usersâ requirements and check the feasibility of our product idea, we conducted some
              preliminary prototyping.

            <p>
              To test the ability of the endoscope device to remove subepithelial lesions we used several plastic and
              silicone stomach models to test the flexibility and material requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
              Eventually for our first prototype, we decided to use cloth to model the functionality of the resection
              device because we could easily modify the size and texture cloth skin and insert our âlesionsâ in between
              the layers.

              we obtained from Dr. Ravi from SGH.

              We then 3D-printed a 2x scale attachment that fits on the scale model to fit an off-the-shelf USB Camera.
              This allowed us to test the functionality and visibility of the device. This second prototype was used to
              test Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR), using the STERIS Polypectomy Snare.

              After the EMR test, we used a transparent rubber hose and other metal parts from drain cleaning tools to
              model the Cookie Cutter attachment and used it to test Endoscopic Full Thickness Resection (EFTR) using
              the Micro-Tech Hemostasis Clip as a forceps.

              deploy the forceps because attempting this procedure requires multiple personnel.

          <h2>11. Future Work</h2>
          <p>
            Our projected timeline for future work is shown in Figure 18. We have identified the problem and the needs
            of the clinicians, nurses and patients at the Ambulatory Endoscopy Centre (AEC) at SGH. We have been working
            closely with our clinical mentor, Dr. Ravishankar Asokkumar and our industry mentor, Mr. Peter Cheng in our
            concept development. Following which, we have also developed our first prototype and will proceed on to
            further testing. Moving forward, we will work with our mentors to test our prototype further and conduct
            preliminary data collection.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope to build a complete, physical device showcasing the functionality of our full thickness
            resection device and collect data using a stomach analogue to demonstrate that it is just as safe and
            effective as surgical wedge resection, while being faster than ESD. We also hope to show that our device can
            securely capture the subepithelial lesion and ensure complete resection while reducing the risk of
            perforation and retaining resection efficiency and validate that our device has indeed improved on
            challenges faced by endoscopists when using the FTRDÂ® System.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, we need to design a new clip with a new clip release mechanism. Dr. Ravi does not like the OTSC clip
            and wants a circular closing clip which can clip and cut consecutively in a single mechanism immediately
            after determining enough tissue has been pulled in, because the stomach is constantly moving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, we need to figure out the cookie cutter deployment mechanism. We are considering using a pneumatic
            or hydraulic system, using either air or saline to deploy the cookie cutter to secure the lesion boundary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Third, we need to ensure that the cap can form a vacuum seal around the lesion. We intend to prototype the
            suction force using a syringe to generate the vacuum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fourth, we need to validate the effectiveness of the miniature ultrasound probe to obtain accurate visual
            feedback that the lesion is fully captured under the mucosal surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last, we need to make a better stomach analogue using silicone or a pig stomach to model the multiple layers
            (mucosa, submucosa, muscularis propria and serosa), the texture and flexibility of the stomach wall. This
            will allow us to collect sufficient data to validate the effectiveness of our procedure and device.
