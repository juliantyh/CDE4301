          I would like to express my deepest appreciation to my team members from the DukeNUS Healthcare Immersion
          Programme (DHIP), Ms Low Xizhi and Ms Nichol Hoong for their contributions to the project and the lecturers
          Dr. Rena Dharmawan, Dr. Bipin Bhola, Dr. Alok Mishra and Mr Hugh Mason for their guidance and support
          throughout the project. Also, our clinical mentor Mr. Peter Cheng from Endofotonics and Dr. Ravishankar
          Asokkumar from SGH who provided us with technical advice throughout the journey. I would also like to thank
          the admin staff Ms Zhuang Yixin, Ms Pang Hui Juan Joyce and Ms Puspa D/O Thangavelu for their support.
          Additionally, I would like to thank my project supervisor, Dr. Mark Chong who has provided me with suggestions
          and guidance over the past semester. His feedback and expertise have provided us with insightful knowledge and
          led us to improve many aspects of our project, particularly in the identification and deeper understanding of
          how to tackle the problem using the Biodesign Framework.
          In addition, we would also like to thank all the clinicians and staff at SGH for taking time off their work to
          assist us in the familiarization of endoscopic surgical techniques during our clinical immersion.
          Finally, we would like to thank Ms. Annie Tan from the DCP Electronics Lab who has given invaluable
          suggestions and technical help in developing our prototype.

    <h2> 1. Introduction </h2>
    <p>
      This project is done in collaboration with DukeNUS and SGH to increase the adoption of endoscopic resection by
      Gastroenterologists for pre-cancerous gastric subepithelial lesions (Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors and
      Neuroendocrine Neoplasms) and early gastric cancer less than 3 cm, from 2% to 40% within 5 years, by achieving
      efficacy (R0 resection rates) and safety (complication rates) comparable to the gold standard of surgical
      resection and making the procedure easier, safer and faster.
      There are two main techniques for endoscopic submucosal resection.
      1) Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD), the current standard-of-care resection technique where the endoscopist
      cuts into the mucosa, removes the lesion and closes the wound left behind
      2) Endoscopic Full Thickness Resection (EFTR), using the OVESCO FTRD® System which is a 3-in-1 device that does a
      full-thickness or deep wall resection to grab hold of the lesion, resect it and close the wound left behind.
      Currently, In Singhealth, only SGH and CGH provide endoscopic resection procedures for sub-epithelial tumors.
      Additionally, only 2% of Gastroenterologists in the USA perform endoscopic resection of subepithelial lesions
      using Full Thickness Resection Device, the FTRD® System (XX, 2024). From our interviews at the SGH Ambulatory
      Endoscopy Centre (AEC), two endoscopists are confident to attempt the FTRD procedure with a high success rate. We
      ascertained that ESD and FTRD are complex and difficult procedure due to the following problems:
      1) ESD is a time consuming and difficult procedure
      2) During EFTR, it is difficult to determine if the lesion has been completely resected
      3) During EFTR, it is difficult to ensure that the endoscopic clips close mucosal defects sufficiently to prevent
      blood leakage resulting in complications and need for hospitalization.
      Our device SafeCut™ makes the process of endoscopic resection of gastric subepithelial lesions and early gastric
      cancer just as safe and effective as surgical wedge resection, while being faster than the current
      standard-of-care endoscopic resection technique, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD). It also improves on
      challenges faced by endoscopists when using the 3-in-1 FTRD® System to securely capture submucosal lesions and
      ensure complete resection, reducing the risk of perforation, while retaining the resection efficiency.

  <h2> 2. Problem Clarification </h2>
  </div>

  <div id="sub-section-4-header-1">
    <h3>2.1. Stakeholder Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      From our interview with stakeholders at SGH, we have identified three main stakeholders:
      1. Endoscopists want the resection of subepithelial lesions to safer and easier by ensuring that mucosal defects
      are closed, and the lesion is completely removed.
      2. Patients find the bi-yearly screenings inconvenient and face stress and anxiety from living with tumours. They
      also want to remove them endoscopically in a single session.
      3. Nurses take 1 year to master endoscopic procedure and >3 months to stabilize holding of the snare.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="sub-section-4-header-2">
    <h3>2.2. Target Audience</h3>
    <p>
      Primary Target Audience: Gastroenterologists who currently perform endoscopic resection of gastric subepithelial
      lesions and early gastric cancers.
      Secondary Target Audience: Physicians (other gastroenterologists, surgeons) who are trained in
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) to diagnose gastric subepithelial lesions and early gastric cancers, but do not
      perform endoscopic resection.

  <h2> 3. Market Analysis and Existing Solutions </h2>
  <p>
    We conducted market analysis of existing solutions and products for Endoscopic Submucosal Resection. Each existing
    solution has its strengths and weaknesses.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div id="section-header-6"></div>
  <h2> 4. Value Proposition </h2>
  <p>
    To fill the identified gap in the market, we have developed the following value proposition:
    “SafeCut™ makes the process of endoscopic resection of gastric subepithelial lesions and early gastric cancer just
    as safe and effective as surgical wedge resection, while being faster than the current standard-of-care endoscopic
    resection technique, Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD). It also improves on challenges faced by endoscopists
    when using the 3-in-1 Full Thickness Resection Device (FTRD® System) with regards to securely capturing submucosal
    lesions and ensuring complete resection, and reducing the risk of perforation, while retaining the resection
    efficiency.”

  </div>

  <div id="section-header-7"></div>
  <h2> 5. Design Methodology </h2>
  <p>
    The Jobs To Be Done represents the necessary tasks that the device has to fulfill. Pains and Gains represent where
    our device can differentiate itself from market competitors. As mentioned in the value proposition, the key needs we
    are targeting are Shorter Procedure Time and Complete Resection.
